# LinkedIn Career Coaches
A list of active career coaches on LinkedIn I'm connected with.

This is either to find some help because you've been laid off from work related to COVID-19, you are still struggling to find a job, or you want to follow along and get some industry insights as you're working.

This list is not exhaustive. As of this time, it has career coaches I'm connected with myself.

_You need a LinkedIn account in order to comment and like the posts these career coaches make. Also, please respect the LinkedIn Code of Conduct._

_If you want to send a connection request, please leave a personalized note explaining things in common, such as you seeing them in a webinar. A connection request without an impactful message will most likely be ignored; show them your interest!_
